## 1. What does this repository contain?
In my opinion, Kaggle is a data science competition site (data science includes AI). So the warehouse will record the notebooks I compete in kaggle, and classify the notebooks into different folders.

## 2. How can it help you?
Whether you are a classmate studying artificial intelligence or a colleague who is interested in magical AI, you can learn how to analyze and solve problems in the notebook. Of course, there must still be some deficiencies in my notebook, and you are welcome to criticize and correct me.

However, in addition to studying, I still recommend you to participate in the competition on kaggle. There is an old saying in China: If you get on paper, you will eventually feel shallow. If you know this, you must do it yourself.
